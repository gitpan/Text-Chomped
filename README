NAME
    Text::Chomped - A chomp and chop that will return the chomped and
    chopped

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        # Old way
        sub sentence {
            my $value = <<_END_
    A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
    _END_
            chomp $value;
            return $value;
        }

        # New way
        use Text::Chomped;

        sub sentence { chomped <<_END_ }
    A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
    _END_

        # Chomp a list (have to use [], sorry)

        my @got = chomped [ "A\n", "b", "c\n", ... ]

        # ... or ...
        my $got = chomped [ "A\n", "b", "c\n", ... ]
        $got->[0] # A

DESCRIPTON
    Text::Chomped will export "chomped" and "chopped" which behave like
    "chomp" and "chop" except return the cho[mp]ped value rather than what
    was cho[mp]ped off (the character)

    Unfortunately subroutine prototyping in Perl cannot ape the builtin
    chomp/chop prototype, so you'll have to pass in an ARRAY reference if
    you want to chomp/chop a list

    Another consequence of the above, is that we can't use $_ without making
    the interface annoying, so you can't do:

        map { chomped } "A\n", "b", "c\n"

    You have to do:

        map { chomped $_ } "A\n", "b", "c\n"
